## The BioJS team

__The BioJS development team is happy to participate in Google Summer of Code 2015.__ We are an international team developing beautiful, interactive and easy-to-share JavaScript applications for visualization of biological data. This website gives an overview of project ideas we are offering to students who wish to spend their summer working with us. We are looking for excellent students for collaboration on the following projects.

## GSoC 2014

Last year we participated for the first time in the GSoC.
You can enjoy this visual presentation from our students about their projects.
