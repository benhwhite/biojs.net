Rationale
---------

At the core of BioJS is its components. We are constantly working on cool ways on how to present our webcomponents to the public. 
Our BioJS registry allows users to interact and play around with our visualisations. 

One of the main challenges of a fast growing community like BioJS is to maintain, improve and develop our existing components.
Currently, every component is located in a repository in GitHub and is maintained by its owner. 
Your task is to help them out - Get in contact with our contributors and help them to take our existing components to the next level.

Approach
--------

Have a look at our registry. We are proud maintainer of ~90 web components. 
We present our components via snippets of examples which can be customized.  
The task is to support all of our components with working snippets.
Use the chance to report all bugs you find and make suggestions on how to improve the reusability and modularity of each component.
