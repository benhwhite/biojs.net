Rationale & Approach
--------------------

There are [several modules that would be useful for bionode](https://github.com/bionode/bionode#list-of-modules) that can be grouped in:
* Data access (from web APIs)
* Data parsing/wrangling
* Tools wrappers

The student could work on improving an existing module or writing from scratch a module that has been requested. If the student is interested in several small modules, improving their architecture and integration among themselves and other UNIX tools could have a huge impact on the usability of the project.

Challenges
----------

The challenges will depend on the module(s) the student is interested in, but there are enough options to adapt to a very diverse range and level of skills.

Involved Tools / Libraries
--------------------------

* Depends on the module, but everything from web APIs (e.g., NCBI) to command line tools (e.g., SAMTOOLS).
* Node.js/JavaScript

Needed Skills

JavaScript/Node.js
