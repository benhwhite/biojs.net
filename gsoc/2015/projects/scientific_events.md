Rationale & Approach
-------------------

Getting a clear overview of scientific events is not a trivial task. Ensuring that information is accurate and reliable, yet secure from malicious attack, requires curators to sift carefully through Internet content to identify and annotate pertinent events. Current methods for dissemination of events in the life sciences are, however, fragmented and uncoordinated: some announcements never reach parts of their intended target audience, and many spam unintended recipients. iAnn is an open source community-driven platform for dissemination of life science announcements, such as courses, conferences and workshops. The purpose of this work is to write a module for visualisation of events. This module will represent scientific events, enabling the visualisation of events in a list, table, calendar, map, and so on following best practices and the adoption of microdata with Schema.org
