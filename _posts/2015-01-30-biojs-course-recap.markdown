What an awesome semester! This year we took BioJS Education to the next level. Not only did we completely redesigned the edu page.
We also worked hard at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) to teach BioJS, Open Source and JavaScript to our students.

The Technical University of Munich (TUM) is a research university with campuses in Munich, Garching and Freising-Weihenstephan. 
It is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology, and is widely considered to be 
one of the best university for computer science in germany.

An overview of our [first BioJS course][pp2] can be found here.
All slides and teaching material are publicly available. 
In the beginning of the course students are taught the basics of JavaScript and web 
visualization. In the practical part of the BioJS course students work on real-world
problems and - guided by motivated scientist from around the world - they create
fancy open source visualization (as BioJS components).
In just 12 weeks, our students started from being JavaScript Newbies into becoming BioJS experts and developed and maintain their own component as part of an exercise.

We were very happy to see the rapid progress and the joy of many of our students.

You can see a more detailed summary of this year's projects [here][projects].

To support our students in their endevour, we organised two hackathons and countless of office hours. 
We are proud to announce that all components made it into our registry and many of our students are considering and doing the extra effort in writing some awesome papers
about their components. So stay tuned!
